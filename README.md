# Cplusplus-Program
#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

For this project Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12 and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock and you will need to apply program logic by creating two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.

#What did you do particularly well?

For this project I thought I did particularly well with planning out my code and then executing that code. I also thought I did a good job of coding incrementally that way I would avoid finishing the project and coming across a ton of different bugs I would have to solve all at once.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think I could enhance my code by maybe replacing the cin clear and ignore with a function. The code otherwise to me looks pretty simple as it gets.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
 
I looked at how other people wrote conditions to advance clocks and used them as guidelines, I found many helpful pointers on stackoverflow. I had to look hard to get cin clear and ignore working properly because I was having many issues with that at first.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

This project I think gave me a better understanding of functions and using different functions together. I know functions are a core part of programming so I think that it will definitely transfer over to other courses and projects.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

To keep the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I tried to keep my code up to industry standards as best I could. That means following proper coding guidelines to keep it looking clean and trying to avoid redundant code etc.
